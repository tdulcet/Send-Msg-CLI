# Python3 port

This is the Python port of the already excellent Bash Script.

I will use the PyPi package manager to upload this.

# Features

The features included in this script will not likely have all the 
features contained in the bash script. However, the following features are
necessary:
1) email notification
2) text notification

# Road Map

~1) Make basic PyPi installation to get the idea of how it will work~
 ~- follow these instructions: https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/~
2 or 3) Setup text and email notification
 - follow these instructions: https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/
4) add advanced functionality.
 - create a list of phone provider gateways to output to user.
 - add other more advanced script features.
 - compile to binary(?) and set a CLI command to the PATH variable so a 
   user can use a CMDLine shortcut.
