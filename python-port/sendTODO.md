1. 1) Fix regex for checking emails to account for case "danc2@pdxedu"
No, it needs a TLD. If you try it with my script, you will get: Error: "danc2@pdxedu" is not a valid e-mail address.. Look at my three regular expressions on lines 371-373, you should be able to paste them into the website you shared, to understand what they do. You will need to use those (obviously without the POSIX character classes, as we discussed) if you want to correctly validate the e-mail addresses.

4. Do not need the second convert_bytes if the size < 1000 bytes, as both IEC and SI formats will be equal. (lines 190 and 192)


1. Allow a local SMTP server to be used (use port 25). That is, check if they are using a local SMTP server first (try/except), then see if they are using (and you can use) the smtps://smtp.gmail.com command, then try port 4__. Look at Starred message on SMTPS/SMTP from Teal for more context.

3. Look at authenticating your app for those that are restricted to commandline interfaces only. I will get an errror that wants me to open up a browser... an error like this:

Dan, I sent some information for you on WhatsApp that maybe would be useful for you :D

You may check when you have time :)

Enjoy! :D

God bless all of us :) üôè

Greetings,

Vina

Hello Dan,

I thought you would reply me on WhatsApp :D , however it's fine if we continue our conversation on here as it'll be easier for each of us to remember the previous message(s) :)

Wow, to be honest I just knew about the news from you that China is the cause of it (Corona). However, I am curious about the motivation(s) behind the creation üòÇ. What do you think, Dan? What are the motivation(s) of the country to create it according to your perspectives?

Ahh I see. And yes, Dan, I also heard from the story of a friend of mine who has just passed his PhD in Political Science that PhD is usually associated with a graduate research position. And yes, it would always be better to wait until being ready for a PhD. As I also think that doing PhD is not such an easy thing, so all should have been well-thought beforehand. One wisdom to be thought: "good thing(s) take time". So be patient is a crucial key as well for this case :)üëçüôè

And hahaha why do you think the word "guru" is very funny, Dan, if I may know? üòÇ :D

Hahaha, thanks, Dan :D. However we'll see what happens next :D. And ehmm to be honest, I'm a kind of pretty determinded person who loves to think about possibilities üòÇ. So that's why I think by having some foreign language certificates, I wish that they would help me to increase more possibilities for me to work in the field of communications and project management in a wider context (read: international level :D).

And if a person asked me whether they sounded difficult to do. Ehmm I think itvall depends. If we did something wholeheartedly, I think all would sound easier :) furthermore, I have felt that all the things in this world are worth to try as long as we want to :) hehehe. I don't think I'm smart, however that's all I have always believed in my life :D and I don'r t think I'm academically inclined, to me, pursuing higher degree (particularly Master's degree) in a particular major will be more like making solution(s) of cases related to the major in a structured way with some (possible) methodologies :), what do you think, Dan, according to your experience?

And I don't think I wanna apply for Fullbright Scholarship haha :D as I've got 2.87 as my finaly G.P.A in undergraduate level üòÇ. So maybe the other full scholarship like the one from USAID that aims to improve the capacity of Professional people from Developing country like Indonesia :D

Ahh I see. However if I may know, what are the specific difference(s) between Computer Science and Computer Engineering, Dan? and what made you think that you probably wanna study the former one?

And Ahh I see. The debts of yours for both of the degrees would take about 5 years to pay down. However I think they're worth to do, Dan :). Wisdom for this paragraph: "this too shall pass (and so will the possible debts :D)"

and about me? Hehehe like you, I think it all also depends :D. That means all depends on my luck whether I'd get the full (professional) scholarship or not. If not getting the scholarship, maybe I'd try other professional development program(s) in Europe as I'd have those foreign language certificates and some work experiences in foreign companies and institutions as well :D.

To be honest I've always loved to work with foreign people and explore more about other cultures especially outside Asia, as I also wanna know more about other perspectives outside the continent where I've always been living :D üòÇüòÑ, and how about you? Do you have any interest on different culture(s) outside the U.S.? :)

Best Regards,

Vina
